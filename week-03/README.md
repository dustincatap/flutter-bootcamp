# Week 3: API Integration, Lists & Persistence

Welcome to Week 3 of the Flutter Bootcamp! This week focuses on connecting your Flutter applications to the real world by integrating external data sources and implementing local data storage. You'll learn how to fetch data from REST APIs, display dynamic content in list-based user interfaces, and persist data locally on the device. By the end of the week, you'll be able to create data-driven applications that work seamlessly with backend services and maintain user data across app sessions.

## Topics Covered

- **Fetch Data from REST APIs**: Learn how to make HTTP requests to REST APIs, handle JSON data, parse responses, and manage asynchronous operations using async/await and Future.
- **Display List-Based UI**: Master the art of displaying dynamic data using ListView, GridView, and custom list items, including handling large datasets efficiently with builders.
- **Save Simple Data Locally**: Implement local data persistence using shared_preferences and simple file storage to save user preferences, settings, and application state.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 3, you will be able to:
- Make HTTP requests to REST APIs and handle responses
- Parse JSON data and convert it to Dart objects
- Display dynamic data using ListView and GridView widgets
- Implement efficient list rendering for large datasets
- Save and retrieve data locally using shared_preferences
- Handle loading states, errors, and network connectivity issues
- Build complete data-driven applications with API integration and local storage
