# Week 4: State Management & Final Project

Welcome to Week 4 of the Flutter Bootcamp! This is the final week where you'll bring everything together and elevate your skills with professional state management patterns. You'll learn how to manage complex application state using **Cubit**, separate business logic from UI components, and build a complete, production-ready e-commerce application. By the end of the week, you'll have created a polished, real-world app that demonstrates all the concepts learned throughout the bootcamp.

## Topics Covered

- **State Management with Cubit**: Learn the Cubit pattern for managing application state, understand how to separate business logic from UI, and build scalable Flutter applications with clean architecture.
- **Shopping Cart Implementation**: Build a complete shopping cart system with add, remove, and update operations, manage cart state with Cubit, and persist cart data locally using SharedPreferences.
- **Complete App Development**: Combine all bootcamp concepts—UI building, navigation, API integration, local persistence, and state management—to create a polished, production-ready e-commerce application.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 4, you will be able to:
- Implement Cubit pattern for state management in Flutter applications
- Separate business logic from UI components using Cubits
- Manage complex application state with multiple Cubits (products, cart, theme)
- Build a complete shopping cart with local persistence
- Integrate state management with API calls and handle async operations
- Implement search and filter functionality with reactive state updates
- Create a production-ready application with proper architecture and code organization
